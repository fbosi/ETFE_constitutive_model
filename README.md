# ETFE_constitutive_model

This repository contains the main file, which is a MATLAB script (etfeLvemodel.m) that contains the implementation of the linear viscoelastic modelling of ETFE material and two examples (uniaxial tensile test and relaxation experiment) to compare the model predictions with experimental data.

The additional files include the material parameters (EAii_1e5MPa.csv contain the activation energy needed for the time shift factor according to Arrhenius law, while Dii_Opt_1e5MPa.csv have the parameters of the Prony series for the creep compliance master curves) and the raw experimental data needed for the two examples.
